        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Takoyaki is a japanese street food that has tako (squid) inside and other more vegetables. One of my favorite!</p>
        <h3> Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Eggs. Eggs make up the majority of the batter and help it get crisp.</li>
            <li> Flour. Flour binds everything together into a very loose batter.</li>
            <li> Dashi powder. Dashi powder is what gives the batter it’s flavor – it’s a simple shortcut way of incorporating dashi (Japanese soup stock) into the base. You can buy dashi powder in the Asian grocery store or online. It adds a bunch of flavor and umami.</li>
            <li> Soy sauce. This is just to add some extra flavor.</li>
            <li> Octopus/tako. The reason why we’re here! You can buy already cooked tako at the Asian grocery store in the seafood section. Cut the tako up into cubes.</li>
            <li> Green onions. These add a bit of freshness to the takoyaki.</li>
            <li> Tenkasu. Tenkasu is tempura bits! They add texture and aroma. If you don’t have any (they sell them in bags at the Asian grocery store) then you can sub in rice krispies.</li>
            <li> Takoyaki sauce. A thick brown sweet and savory sauce.</li>
            <li> Kewpie mayo. This is essential and gives your octopus balls that iconic look.</li>
            <li> Bonito flakes. These flakes are what make your takoyaki look like it’s dancing! They are delicate, paper thin shaved dried fish that wave around from the hot steam. They are super savory.</li>
            <li> Seaweed. A little green sprinkle of powdered seaweed. </li>
            <li> A takoyaki pan. You can buy them for not too much money online, or if you have a Danish-style ebelskiver pan, that’ll work great too.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Mix. Mix the batter up with a whisk making sure there are no floury bits.</li>
            <li> Prep. Prep all of the fillings. Cut up the octopus, slice the green onions and make sure you have everything at the ready: a little dish of oil, all your ingredients, some skewers to flip the balls, and a plate to serve on. Heat up the pan.</li>
            <li> Pour and fill. Generously oil the pan with a brush or a paper towel dipped in oil. Give the batter a whisk then pour into the individual compartments all the way up to the top. It’s okay if they overflow a bit. Add in the fillings and let cook until the edges start to look more solid and opaque.</li>
            <li> Flip. Use your skewers to turn the takoyaki 90 degrees. If they don’t easily move, they need more time to crisp up. Once they’re at a 90° angle, pour in a bit more batter to ensure a super round ball. Let cook, stuffing in any excess batter that’s outside the ball, then turn again. You should have a round ball. Cook until the balls are crispy and brown, moving the balls around from mold to mold to evenly cook (this is because most pans will have uneven heating). As the balls crisp up, it will be easier to flip them.</li>
            <li> Sauce. When the balls are golden and crisp, pop them on a plate and brush with takoyaki sauce and squeeze on some mayo.
                Top. Finish with a sprinkle of bonito and aonori. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
