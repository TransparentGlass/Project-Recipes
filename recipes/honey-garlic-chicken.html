        <li> 2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li> 4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup honey</li>

        <li> 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp chili flakes</li>
        <li> hot steaming rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken thighs in a bowl and add the cornflour (cornstarch), salt, and pepper. Toss the chicken in the cornflour until fully coated.
            8 chicken thighs, 2 tbsp cornflour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a high heat.
            2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken thighs, and cook on one side until golden brown (about 4-5 minutes), then turn over and cook for a further 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the butter to the pan, let it melt, then add the garlic and stir together. Turn the heat down to medium so the garlic doesn't burn, then make the sauce.
1 tbsp unsalted butter, 4 cloves minced garlic.
        </li>
        <li> To make the sauce, combine the honey, stock, rice vinegar, and light soy sauce in a bowl and stir together.
            110 g (1/3 cup) honey, 80 ml (1/3 cup) chicken stock, 1 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li> Add the sauce to the pan. Turn the heat up and bring the sauce to the boil, then simmer for 4-5 minutes until the sauce reduces and thickens, and the chicken is cooked through (and no longer pink in the middle).</li>
        <li> Sprinkle on the chopped parsley and chilli flakes and serve over boiled rice.
            1 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley, 1/2 tsp chilli flakes, boiled rice</li>
